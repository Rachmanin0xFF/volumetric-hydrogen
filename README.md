# volumetric-hydrogen
A realtime volumetric visualization of the hydrogen-like atom's eigenfunctions.

I wrote this because I was tired of seeing atomic orbitals represented with hard isosurfaces.
This is a WIP; eventually I'll publish it to my website with some nice controls (maybe a writeup / educational video as well).

In the meantime, though, you can view a working copy [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cdSSDw).
